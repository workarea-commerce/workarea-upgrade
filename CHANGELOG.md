Workarea Upgrade 3.0.4 (2020-06-30)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*   Fix incomplete Rails environment (#7)

    Ran in to an issue where running this would throw an error about a missing ActionView constant.
    Found reports of the same error in other rails-adjacent projects where part of the base rails
    libraries weren't getting loaded or were loading in the wrong order. Explicitly pulling in
    the ActionView railtie here seems to have fixed the problem.

Workarea Upgrade 3.0.3 (2020-02-05)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*   Loosen Bundler Version Constraint

    Allow any version of Bundler 2 to be used with `Workarea::Upgrade` so
    that users can install the right version on their apps.

    UPGRADE-8

Workarea Upgrade 3.0.2 (2019-12-17)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*   Pass supplied options to Diff

    Diffy formatting wasn't working due to a blunder in the way we were
    supplying options to Diffy::Diff

    UPGRADE-3
    Curt Howard

*   Fix invocation bug when running `workarea_upgrade prepare -l`

    The `--latest` option breaks the `prepare` -> `report` invocation chain
    in the CLI. This fix passes empty hashes around to all invocations used
    in the CLI.

    UPGRADE-5
    Curt Howard

*   Avoid Method Errors When Upgrading New Gems

    When a new gem has been included in an upgrading gem's dependencies, an
    error can be thrown when viewing the diff or report if the gem is not
    already included in the app's Gemfile prior to running the upgrade
    tools. Ensure that `Workarea::Upgrade::Diff#find_from_path!` returns
    `nil` when this occurs, and the diff generator skips over gems that it
    cannot produce a `Workarea::Upgrade::GemDiff` for.

    UPGRADE-7
    Tom Scott

*   Add theme upgrade notes to README

    ECOMMERCE-5355
    Curt Howard

*   Migrate dragonfly assets to v3.x cleanly

    When v2.x clients use the v3 migration script, none of their content
    assets can be found because the job ID has changed as we upgraded the
    Dragonfly library. When upgrading Dragonfly assets, try to find an asset
    match by the filename of the image rather than the entire asset URL.
    This isn't 100% perfect because we don't validate uniqueness on content
    asset filenames, but it should get us most of the way there.

    UPGRADE-30
